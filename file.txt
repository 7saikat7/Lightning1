How wonderful it is to watch the sky after sunset! One
would first notice one or two bright dots shining in
the sky. Soon you would see the number increasing.
You cannot count them any more. The whole sky is
filled with tiny shining objects – some are bright, others
dim. It seems as if the sky is studded with diamonds.
They all appear to be twinkling. But if you look at
them carefully you will notice that some of them do
not twinkle as others do. They simply glow without
any flicker just as the moon shines.
Along with these bright objects, you may also see
the moon on most of the days. It may, however, appear
at different times, in different shapes and at different
positions. You can see the full moon only once in about
a month’s time. It is Full moon night or Poornima. A
fortnight later, you cannot see it at all. It is a New
moon night or Amavasya. On this day, you can watch
the night sky best, provided it is a clear night.
Do you wonder why can’t we see the moon and all
those bright tiny objects during day time? It is because
the very bright light of the sun does not allow us to see
all these bright objects of the night sky.
The sun, the moon and all those objects shining in
the night sky are called celestial bodies.
Some celestial bodies are very big and hot. They
are made up of gases. They have their own heat and
light, which they emit in large amounts. These celestial
bodies are called stars. The sun is a star.
Countless twinkling stars in the night sky are
similar to the sun. But we do not feel their heat or
light, and they look so tiny because they are very very far
from us.
